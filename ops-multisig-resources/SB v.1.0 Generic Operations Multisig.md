<sup>8</sup>

3.5. Conflicts of Interest Generally. Each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to continuously monitor and evaluate such Party's personal facts and circumstances (including a Party's direct and indirect business and other economic interests in the Protocol Ecosystem and other blockchain-based companies, systems, and communities) that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a material conflict of interest on the part of such Party in connection with such Party's performance of its role and duties under this Agreement.

3.5.1 Ongoing Conflicts. If a Party becomes aware of an ongoing material conflict of interest with respect to any Party's (including such Party's) execution of their respective role hereunder, such Party shall promptly resign or otherwise be removed from participation in their role in accordance with the provisions contained herein, including without limitation the Multisig Procedures, unless such conflict of interest has been disclosed to the other Parties in reasonable detail, and a majority of the uninterested Active Signers affirmatively consent to such Party continuing to participate in the Multisig Scheme notwithstanding such conflict of interest (which consent, for the avoidance of doubt, may be conditioned on appropriate disclosure to such additional parties in the Protocol Ecosystem as may be referenced in the Governance Vote or Multisig Procedures).

3.5.2 One-Off Conflicts. If a Party becomes aware of a material conflict of interest with respect to any Party (including such Party) relating to a specific Signature Request, such Party shall promptly disclose such conflict of interest to the other Parties and refrain from further involvement with such Signature Request, including by refraining from making a Signature Decision with respect to such Signature Request.
<sup>9</sup>

3.6 Removals; Sole Remedy for Breach.

3.6.1. Breach. Upon any material breach of this Agreement by any Party, removal shall constitute the sole remedy for such breach under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the following occurrences shall, without limitation, constitute material breaches by any Party hereto: (i) any conflict of interest that is not disclosed and, if applicable, affirmatively consented to in accordance with Section 3.5; (ii) any material failure to follow the MultiSig Procedures; or (iii) any breach of the confidentiality provisions set forth in Section 3.8.

3.6.2. Remedies. In the event of a material breach by a Party of its duties hereunder, a majority of the non-breaching Parties hereto may terminate any such breaching Party's status as an Active Signer, duties (other than the surviving obligations referred to in Section 4) and right to participate in the Multisig Scheme, with or without prior notice, and may de-permission Party's Key from the Multisig Scheme or demand that Party relinquish or destroy such Party's Key.

For the avoidance of doubt, a Party's status as an Active Signer hereunder may also be terminated by any other method permitted by the Multisig Scheme **.** From and after any termination of a Party's status as an Active Signer hereunder, such Party shall refrain from, as applicable: using such Party's Key; acting upon Signature Requests; or exercising any of the rights, powers, or privileges of Party under this Agreement or otherwise available to Party in connection with the Multisig Scheme.

3.7 Vacancies; Additional Parties. If at any time there are fewer Active Signers validly participating in the Multisig Scheme than the maximum number of Keys permitted to participate at a given time in the Multisig Scheme (each, a **"**  **Vacancy**  **"** ), the following provisions shall apply:

3.7.1 Vacancies in Active Signers. In the event of a Vacancy among the Active Signers, a majority of the Active Signers may propose a person not already party to this Agreement to be designated as a Party and Active Signer to fill such Vacancy. Such person shall be designated a Party after (i) a majority of the Active Signers provide written consent to such designation; and (ii) such person becomes a party to this Agreement by executing and delivering an additional counterpart signature page to this Agreement. Thereafter, such person shall be deemed be a party to and bound by this Agreement as a Party.

3.7.2 Frustration of Purpose. In the event [(i) a Vacancy is not filled pursuant to Section 3.7.1 within [] days or (ii)] Vacancies pursuant to Section 3.7.1 render the Multisig Scheme unable to execute transactions in the ordinary course,
<sup>10</sup>
 it shall constitute a termination event under Section 4 and the remaining Parties to the Multisig Scheme shall execute a transaction to return any undeployed portion of the Designated Ops Budget to the party who funded the Multisig Scheme or as otherwise directed in the Governance Vote.
<sup>11</sup>

3.8. Confidentiality. The identities of the Parties who have expressed a desire to remain anonymous (ie. are not personally identified in the Governance Vote or hereinafter execute a joinder on the condition of anonymity) as well as all discussions and communications among or involving the Parties in their capacities as such which are conspicuously marked by a Party as "confidential" or, if oral, identified as confidential at the time of disclosure, or promptly confirmed in writing, shall be deemed "Confidential Information". Each Party shall maintain the confidentiality of, and shall not disclose, publish or make available, all Confidential Information: provided, however, that the foregoing covenants shall not apply to a particular Party and particular Confidential Information to the extent that: (a) such Confidential Information becomes widely known to the public (other than through such Party's breach of this Agreement); (b) such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by such Party pursuant to the applicable laws or regulations or orders of the court or other government authorities applicable to such Party (provided that such Party provides the other Parties with written notice sufficiently in advance of such disclosure to afford such Parties the other opportunity to seek a protective order or otherwise limit the disclosure of such Confidential Information); or (c) such Confidential Information is disclosed by such Party to its legal counsels or financial advisors with a need to know such Confidential Information in order to provide advice to such Party regarding the transactions contemplated hereunder, provided that such legal counsels or financial advisors, as the case may be, are apprised of the confidential nature of such Confidential Information and are bound by the confidentiality obligations to the Party with respect thereto similar to those set forth in this Section 3.8. Disclosure of any Confidential Information by a third party who received such Confidential Information from a Party and would, if made by such Party, breach this Section 3.8, shall be deemed a breach of this Section 3.8 by such Party. This Section 3.8 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Notwithstanding the above, any Active Signer may, for itself only (and assuming all risks that may arise from such disclosure), make public their status as an Active Signer, but not the existence, terms, or conditions of this Agreement.

4. **Term & Termination**. Each Party's duties and right to participate in the Multisig Scheme shall continue until the earlier of Party's termination of having the status of as Active Signer, as applicable through their removal, death or resignation; _provided, however,_ that: (a) a terminated Party's Duties relevant to the safekeeping and use of Party's Key shall continue until the requisite majority of the Active Signers has de-permissioned such Key from the Multisig Scheme; and (b) all obligations and liabilities of the terminated Party under the provisions of this Agreement that by their nature are intended to survive a termination of contract shall survive and be continuing, including all obligations and liabilities under Section 3.8, this Section 4, Section 5 and Section 6 and all duties and liabilities relating to events prior to the termination date.

5. **Remedies**. The remedies described herein are the sole remedies available to the Parties for breach or non-performance of this Agreement. In furtherance thereof (i) the Parties agree that, as a material inducement to engage participants to serve and hold Keys in the Multisig Scheme, the Parties hereby agree not to pursue legal remedies against the Parties hereto and any current, future or former Active Signer(s);
<sup>12</sup>
 (ii) any duties hereunder are contractual in nature and no fiduciary duties are owed by the Parties hereto; and (iii) Parties further agree to waive any legal claims between themselves, and disclaim any partnership or joint venturer status.

6.2. Mutual Release. Each Party,
<sup>14</sup>
 on its own behalf and on behalf of its successors, heirs and assigns, shall fully and forever release and discharge each other Party and such Party's
<sup>15</sup>
 respective agents, nominees, attorneys, insurers, successors, heirs, and assigns from any and all claims, counterclaims, defenses, setoffs, recoupments, debts, demands, causes of action, suits, obligations, injuries, losses, damages, costs, expenses, attorneys' and expert witness fees, and liabilities of any nature whatsoever, in law or in equity, arising under statute, contract or tort, whether known or unknown, fixed or contingent, pertaining to the Multisig Scheme, and any and all other claims which are or could be raised in connection with the Multisig Scheme.

Subject to the foregoing limitations, the terms of this Agreement may be amended, supplemented, terminated or waived with the written consent of a majority of Active Signers.

6.6. Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is found invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.

Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any Party of any breach or default under this Agreement, or any waiver on the part of any Party of any provisions or conditions of this Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.

6.8. Parties in Interest. All third-party rights are expressly disclaimed. This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and is not for the benefit of, nor any provision hereof be enforced by, any other party.

6.9. Further Assurances.

[1](#sdfootnote1anc) **NTD** : This form is intended to be a generic starter place for a multisig administering an operations budget apportioned to an internal working group by a DAO. It incorporates a number of assumptions which are detailed in the accompanying memo "Ops Multisig Agreements (Low Trust Forms)" (the "Memo"). Please read the Memo in connection with your review of this form, including the disclaimers therein as it provides many additional notes and considerations.
